# Iris-Flower-Species-Prediction-using-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Built a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The project involved cleaning and analyzing the Iris dataset, selecting important features, and training a Naive Bayes classifier to accurately predict flower species based on measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. After training, I evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix to check how well it performs. This project helped me understand probability-based classification and the workflow of building simple ML models.
